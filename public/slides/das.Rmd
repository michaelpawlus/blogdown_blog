# Who Are You?

???

We are going to start with the basics
At last count you are 183 strong
The largest attendance in the last five years of Data Analytics Symposiums
I have enjoyed reading your introductions on the Community Forum
More on that in a minute if you don't know
I noted a lot of positive energy and enthusiasm in that thread
And I am really glad you decided to be here today
This is an analytics conference and you gave me data when you registered so I had to analyze it

???

For just under half of you this is your first Prospect Development Conference
My first conference was in New Orleans
I learned so much (it felt like too much maybe)
I made some great connections
I hope the same for you
I was saying that it can be difficult to explain what we do (it's quite niche)
Here everyone knows what you do
We all speak PD. (It's a little like going to band camp)
The other thing is that while their a good number of you 
This is still a small group relative to PD and I thin there is strength in that

However, you do not need to stay in one track the entire time

## Hearing You...

* Beginner guide to Data Analytics

--

* More diversity in the program

--

* More concept-focused advanced analytics sessions

# New Features

---

class: center, middle

> I think some sort of session/activity that resulted in more interaction with others attending the symposium would be helpful, outside of just talks.

> The lunch break on the first day felt like it disrupted the flow just when the conference was starting to get going.

## As a result...

--

* Lunch Groups

    + Opportunity for participants to gather and discuss a topic rather than having everyone go their separate ways
    
    + Hopefully, encourage conversation and interaction between particpants and not just presenter to participants

--
    
* Office Hours

    + Match those with experience with those seeking to learn 
    
    + Help to facilitate relationships that are like mentor/learner 

--
    
* Community Forum

    + Look for an email for every session (so 20 or so emails)
    
    + Record extra details like if something is discussed spontaneously
    
    + Extra questions and references can be placed in these threads
