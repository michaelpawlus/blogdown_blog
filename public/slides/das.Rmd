# Who Are You?

???

* We are going to start with the basics
* At last count you are 183 strong
* The largest attendance in the last five years of Data Analytics Symposiums
* I have enjoyed reading your introductions on the Community Forum
* More on that in a minute if you don't know
* I noted a lot of positive energy and enthusiasm in that thread
* And I am really glad you decided to be here today
* This is an analytics conference and you gave me data when you registered so I had to analyze it

![](First_pd_0725.png)

???

* For just under half of you this is your first Prospect Development Conference
* My first conference was in New Orleans
* I learned so much (it felt like too much maybe)
* I made some great connections
* I hope the same for you
* I was saying that it can be difficult to explain what we do (it's quite niche)
* Here everyone knows what you do
* We all speak PD. (It's a little like going to band camp)
* The other thing is that while their a good number of you 
* This is still a small group relative to PD and I thin there is strength in that

class: center

![](How_long_np_0725.png)

???

* Many of you have worked in nonprofits for a while but are maybe new to analytics  
* When I started down this road I though I suddenly had super powers  
* However, I also felt really overwhelmed at times  
* My advice is to pick one or two ideas that could have value and share those first  
* Then grow slowly  
* You'll get a lot of ideas today  
* I am hopefully you will find some you can act on now  
* I also hope you find some to work towards later

---

class: center

![](org_type_0725.png)

???

* Many that attend this conference are from Higher Ed and that is still true  
* However, a third of you are from outside Higher Ed (museums, religious organizations, radio)  
* I hope you can find each other because I personally think it can be a bigger challenge
* You may need to swap in other ideas today during sessions
* Instead of looking at data such as Alumni and Parents, you will use different membership classes

---

class: center

![](States_attending_0725.png)

???

* I am so excited that you are from everywhere
* I am glad our message got out to everyone
* I am glad there interest from so many places
* I also just think this is fun for us to learn about so many different places as we talk today

# Let's Talk Format

???

Let's talk about the format for this symposium

---

.pull-left[
**Start-Up Tracks**

* Generally better suited to those just getting started

]

.pull-right[
**Enterprise Tracks**

* Generally better for those from more established shops
]

???

* These are pretty obvious and basic descriptions
* I include these just to get to my next point
* Also in terms of content we used past feedback
* We have several Intro sessions and non-technical sessions
* We have covered most of the major tools and resources
* We definitely have some quite advanced sessions for the more experienced
* Panel will try to address bigger problems later

--

However, you do not need to stay in one track the entire time

--

## Hearing You...

* Beginner guide to Data Analytics

--

* More diversity in the program

--

* More concept-focused advanced analytics sessions

--

* More emphasis on HOW analytics is being used

--

* Overview of the big problems PD/Analytics teams are being asked to solve

# New Features

---

class: center, middle

> I think some sort of session/activity that resulted in more interaction with others attending the symposium would be helpful, outside of just talks.

> The lunch break on the first day felt like it disrupted the flow just when the conference was starting to get going.

???

These are paraphrased but this is the gist
--- 

---
## As a result...

???

* Lunch Groups more details in a minute
* Four topics, completely optional but an opportunity to keep up the momentum
* Office Hours: time to interact and connect learners with those with more experience
* The Forum: I will add sessions later (earlier sessions you will have to add in later)
* I wanted to add these early but couldn't do it silently and wanted to give you a warning

--

* Lunch Groups

    + Opportunity for participants to gather and discuss a topic rather than having everyone go their separate ways
    
    + Hopefully, encourage conversation and interaction between particpants and not just presenter to participants

--
    
* Office Hours

    + Match those with experience with those seeking to learn 
    
    + Help to facilitate relationships that are like mentor/learner 

--
    
* Community Forum

    + Look for an email for every session (so 20 or so emails)
    
    + Record extra details like if something is discussed spontaneously
    
    + Extra questions and references can be placed in these threads

???

* Lunch groups a bit more detail
* Sorry for the crude drawing but hopefully you can get it
* Make a note. I'll put the slide back up at that time
* Each table will have a DAS Committee member available as well 
* So you'll go and get whatever food you want and then bring it back and meet here if you would like
* I am trying something new
* This can be filed under: I can't ask you to do something I wouldn't do myself 
* so these slides are in R and I'm still learning

---

# From Particpants to Collaborators

???

* Take the survey but also talk to me and the commitee (listed later)

---

## Areas where we can work together:

* More presentations on using Python (rather than just R)

* Courses in learning R or learning Python

* More workshops rather than just talks


???

* Let's talk about workshops
* We can do a trial with the Rich thing today
* My concern especially with beginner level is technical issues
* Different starting spaces
* I don't want it to be a frustrating experience
* We can do a course and then talk on Slack 
---

## You can help:

* Give me names of people you know using Python

   + Let's try to get them next year
   
* Let's keep in contact (Slack, Twitter or Community Forum)

  + Speaking of Twitter: #ApraDAS2018 

* Let's set-up challenges using familiar data

    + Send me anonymous data or get in me in touch with presenters sharing anonymized data

* Let's form teams and take classes together

???

* I still feel we need more Python but I don't know many people
* If you do, email me and I'll add them to a list for next year
* We can do more than the Forum (how can we stay connected)
* I want to create a central area for anonymous data
* Easier to share and modify scripts, illustrate ideas
* There are classes -- or we could possibly build something and work remotely
* Options: Please take an active role
* Also okay if you just want to be here for the conference
* If you want to be more involved that would be welcome
