.pull-left[
**Start-Up Tracks**

* Generally better suited to those just getting started

]

.pull-right[
**Enterprise Tracks**

* Generally better for those from more established shops
]

--

However, you do not need to stay in one track the entire time

--

## Hearing You...

* Beginner guide to Data Analytics

--

* More diversity in the program

--

* More concept-focused advanced analytics sessions

--

* More emphasis on HOW analytics is being used

--

* Overview of the big problems PD/Analytics teams are being asked to solve

???

I think we need to change this just to say that you don't need to stay in one track.

---

## A few schedule changes

--

* Jesse Mostipak
    + Could not be here
    + I will fill in with similar content

# New Features

---

class: center, middle

&gt; I think some sort of session/activity that resulted in more interaction with others attending the symposium would be helpful, outside of just talks.

&gt; The lunch break on the first day felt like it disrupted the flow just when the conference was starting to get going.

--- 

---
## As a result...

--

* Lunch Groups

    + Opportunity for participants to gather and discuss a topic rather than having everyone go their separate ways
    
    + Hopefully, encourage conversation and interaction between particpants and not just presenter to participants

--
    
* Office Hours

    + Match those with experience with those seeking to learn 
    
    + Help to facilitate relationships that are like mentor/learner 

--
    
* Community Forum

    + Look for an email for every session (so 20 or so emails)
    
    + Record extra details like if something is discussed spontaneously
    
    + Extra questions and references can be placed in these threads

# From Particpants to Collaborators

---

## Areas where we can work together:

* More presentations on using Python (rather than just R)

* Courses in learning R or learning Python

* More workshops rather than just talks

---

## You can help:

* Give me names of people you know using Python

   + Let's try to get them next year
   
* Let's keep in contact (Slack, Twitter or Community Forum)

  + Speaking of Twitter: #ApraDAS2018 

* Let's set-up challenges using familiar data

    + Send me anonymous data or get in me in touch with presenters sharing anonymized data

* Let's form teams and take classes together

???

Maybe split (You Can Help) to its own slide
