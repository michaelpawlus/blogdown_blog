      <description>World Cup Player Caps and Clubs This is post three in a series using data for all World Cup teams collected in the first post
In the second post we looked explored the ages of players over time, by team and by position as well as checked to see if there was a skewed distribution among birth months.
For this post we will look at caps which is the term used for counting how many appearances a player has made for games at the international level.</description>

 Corrections June 9: Corrected some errors with the x-axis scale in the plotly plots that were present when this was first posted
