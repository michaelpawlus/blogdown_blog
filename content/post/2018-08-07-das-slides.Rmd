**Start-Up Tracks**

]

.pull-right[
**Enterprise Tracks**

However, you do not need to stay in one track the entire time

--

## Hearing You...

* Beginner guide to Data Analytics

--

* More diversity in the program

--

* More concept-focused advanced analytics sessions

???

I think we need to change this just to say that you don't need to stay in one track.

# New Features

---

class: center, middle

> I think some sort of session/activity that resulted in more interaction with others attending the symposium would be helpful, outside of just talks.

> The lunch break on the first day felt like it disrupted the flow just when the conference was starting to get going.

## As a result...

--

* Lunch Groups

    + Opportunity for participants to gather and discuss a topic rather than having everyone go their separate ways
    
    + Hopefully, encourage conversation and interaction between particpants and not just presenter to participants

--
    
* Office Hours

    + Match those with experience with those seeking to learn 
    
    + Help to facilitate relationships that are like mentor/learner 

--
    
* Community Forum

    + Look for an email for every session (so 20 or so emails)
    
    + Record extra details like if something is discussed spontaneously
    
    + Extra questions and references can be placed in these threads
