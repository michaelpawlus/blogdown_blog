# We Can Learn Anything If...

* We have access to the information

--

* We have Three Key Traits:

    + Tenacity/Perseverance (pushing through a challenge)
    
--
    
    + Curiousity/Critical Thinking (seek to discover/understand)
    
--
    
    + Creativity (play to learn)
    
--

* It is also very helpful to have a community

# Why R and Python?

--

* First, use what works for you (not a hard sell)

--

* The answers are out there

--

* Great community

--

* You can access new developments as they emerge

--

* You can continue to grow and contribute (flag issues, fix problems, create packages)

# Objective

--

* Focusing on the process, not the product

--

* The idea is that you have the toolkit to learn anything after this

---

# Why Learn Data Science?

--

* If you have 20% of the skills, you will be in the top 80%

--

* Everyone needs to be able to write and everyone should have some data knowledge these days

--

* Data Analytics is part of the three core areas of Prospect Development

* **We are ready to learn but we are not aiming to be an expert**

# Let's get started

```r
# what does paste0 do?
*paste0("Michael",2)
```

---
class: center, middle


```r
# what does paste0 do?
paste0("Michael",2)
```

```
# [1] "Michael2"
```

---

class: center, middle

## If there is a paste0(), is there a paste()?


```r
# what does paste do?
paste("Michael",2)
```

---
class: center, middle


```r
# what does paste do?
paste("Michael",2)
```

```
# [1] "Michael 2"
```

---

class: center, middle

## Can I put a space in with paste0? How?


```r
# what does paste do?
paste("Michael",2)
```

---

class: center, middle


```r
# what does paste do?
paste("Michael ",2)
```

```
# [1] "Michael  2"
```

---

class: center, middle


```r
# can we paste 3 things? 4 things? Let's play...
paste("Michael ",2,1+1,"Second of his name")
```

---

class: center, middle


```r
# can we paste 3 things? 4 things? Let's play...
paste("Michael ",2,1+1,"Second of his name")
```

```
# [1] "Michael  2 2 Second of his name"
```

## what happens if we don't put text in quotes?

```
paste("Michael ",2,1+1,Second of his name)
```

---

class: center, middle

## what doesn't happen?

# We don't know R

--

* But we know R

--

* We discovered through play

--

* When we didn't know; we tried anyway

--

* Through patterns we expanded our abilities and understanding of what was possible

## Here is something that I didn't know would work




```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
s = pd.Series([1,3,5,np.nan,6,8])
print(s)
```

```
## 0    1.0
## 1    3.0
## 2    5.0
## 3    NaN
## 4    6.0
## 5    8.0
## dtype: float64
```

# Conclusion

--

* I can't say coding is easy (You may find it difficult)

--

* I can't say it's hard (You may not want to try)

--

* I can only say that it is worth it

--

* I hope you get some ideas for using some new resource and you decide to play to discover

--

* See DataSciGuide for places to start

--

* Start learning with friends

--

* Let me know if there is something you want me to cover (I need blog post ideas)

With any code we will Google for the answer
We will get some code
We will play with the code without fear
We wil transpose examples from other fields
