## fundRaising: an idea is born

--

* Are there similar processes that we all do?

--

* ..that are specific to fundraising analytics?

--

* Could we have a central location for these functions?

--

* Can we build this library together so we aren't all repeating work?

## Why this matters

### Meanwhile in the world of open source software

* Everything is transparent

* Seeing the code means you know why something is some way

* With actively maintained work, comments don't go unanswered for years

* You have a more direct way to make a change
